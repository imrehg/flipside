Flash cards based practice with Google Spreadsheets.

Idea
----

Prepare a spreadsheet with a specific format to use it as a practice
data for whatever information you want to train. Need three columns:

`Answers | Questions | Clues`

For example: 

`English expression | Chinese expression | Chinese pronounciation`

Then use this data in a variety of interfaces to present e.g. multiple
choice questions or other puzzles that help you practice


Interfaces
----------

* basic: command line interface for multiple choice questions
* standalone: single html file that implements the functions of basic in a browser
* service: website version that can be hosted and more users can have access in the same time
